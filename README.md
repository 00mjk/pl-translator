# pl-translator
Translate programming language to another via neural networks.

This is a personal challenge I set to myself. As machine translation of human lanugage is largely improved and successful by employing deep neural network. I wonder if a neural network could be trained to translate codes, e.g. Java to Python. This is also a personal investigation of NLP applications since I've never really studied NLP carefully. This is a reasonable target because we've seen that character-level RNN is capable (though not compilable) of writing Linux kernel after learning the entire Linux base source code.

Another related question posed by such task is "learning-to-execute" where the neural network predicts output accoding to the input program. It seems to me that though NNs are potentially powerful of modeling anything, however it's pretty hard to do the logical reasoning or at least it's very hard to train for such purpose. I have a feeling that it needs a novel NN architecture for solving such issue instead of training algorithm advancement. Well, in the end, in past 20 to 30 years, most of significant progresses in NN are with architecture changes rather than optimization.
